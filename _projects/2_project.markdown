Reward bundling is a procedure implemented in delay discounting research which has shown the ability to shift preference from the implusive choice (smaller sooner) to the more economic choice (larger later). I developed a program in Python, using PyGame libriaries, to evaluate the use of a bundling procedure with children with ADHD diagnoses.
