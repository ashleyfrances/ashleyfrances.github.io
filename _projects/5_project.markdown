When a response is extinguished (e.g. challenging behavior) an alternative response is typically introduced. When the alternative response encounters extinction, intentional or not, the previously extinguished response re-emerges. This is clincial resurgence. Differently reinforcing variability in responding across multiple alternative responses is a proven method for mitigating future resurgence. Across a series of experiments, I have developed programs designed for testing different models of resurgence in human operant contexts (e.g. undergraduate students).
