Behavioral variability is a promising area of research/clinical practice for individuals with ASD in particular. For my dissertation, I have developed an application in XCode which facilitates the recording of responses and implementation of schedules of reinforcement (both lag schedules and relative frequency thresholds) which differentially target variability of responding. As promising as these schedules of reinforcement have proven to be in the liturature, the remain impractical for clinical settings.
