Neutral stimuli can ellicit the reinstatement of previously extinguished behavior. This program, written in Python using the Tkinter libraries, implements an experimental arrangement designed to extend findings from an applied setting (e.g. conducted with children with ASD) toward a human operant population. As a proof of concept, this study is enabling our lab to run further variations on the experimental arrangement in an effort to better understand and, potentially, mitigate this phenomenon.
