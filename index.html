<p>I’m a Ph.D. student in the <a href="https://education.utexas.edu/departments/special-education/graduate-programs/autism-developmental-disabilities">Department of Special Eduacation, Autism and Developmental Disabilities</a> at <a href="https://www.utexas.edu/">UT Austin</a>, advised by <a href="https://education.utexas.edu/faculty/terry_falcomata">Dr. Terry Falcomata</a>. My research is in behavioral variability, relapse and resurgence, and behavioral economics - implusivity and self control. To facilitate research across these areas, I have developed computer and app-based programs in Python, Swift, and Visual Basic. See <a href="/blog">projects</a> for examples of programs I have created.</p>

<p>I hold a B.A. in psychology from <a href="https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/psychology/undergraduate/degree/index.php">UT Austin</a>. I also hold an M.S. in behavior analysis from <a href="https://ehs.siu.edu/rehab/graduate/behavior-analysis/masters.php">Southern Illinois University</a>, where I worked on an NIH grant studying behavioral persistence with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LpAhGmkAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Dr. Joel Ringdahl</a>. My Master’s thesis is titled <a href="assets/pdf/bagwell_thesis.pdf">The Effects of Lag Schedules and Multiple Alternatives on Response Resurgence</a>.</p>

<hr />

<p>Over the course of completing my M.S. I worked at a number of organizations where I provided behavioral therapy to clients. I taught self-care, social skills, independent living, and self-advocacy at the <a href="https://ehs.siu.edu/rehab/service-programs/evaluation-development/">Evaluation and Development Center</a>, a residential transitional facility for young adults with disabilites. I worked developing and implementing behvaior plans and facilitating Acceptance and Commitment Therapy groups at <a href="https://www.neurorestorative.com/state-location/carbondale/">NeuroRestorative</a>, a residentail rehabilitation facility for adults recovering from traumatic and/or acquired brain injuries. I worked at <a href="https://project12-ways.siu.edu/">Project 12-Ways</a> throught my M.S., training parents with DCFS involvement to exceed minimum parenting standards using evidence based, behavior analytic interventions.</p>

<p>Over the course of completing my Ph.D. I have expanded my work experience into more research and teaching based applications. I spent my first year working at <a href="http://bbtrails.org/services/autism-services/">Bluebonnet Trails Community Services</a> with children with ASD diagnoses, teaching iPad based communication and writing/implementing behavior plans based in ABA principles in home settings. Currently I work in three education/research based settings. I am the lab manager for the College of Education’s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/UT-Austin-Assistive-and-Instructional-Technology-Lab-1885640858333318/?ref=page_internal">Assistive and Instructional Technology Lab</a> where I facilitate orientations introducing pre-service teachers to assistive technology (AT). I lead the effort to transition the lab to a completely online model at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. This summer I will again serve as the TA for 2-course Applied Behavior Analysis sequence in the Autism and Development Disabilitys Masters program. I am also the manager of the human operant research lab I founded with my advisor in my first semester of my Ph.D. For more details, see my <a href="assets/pdf/CV-Ashley-Bagwell.pdf">CV</a>.</p>
