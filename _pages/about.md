I'm a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Special Eduacation, Autism and Developmental Disabilities](https://education.utexas.edu/departments/special-education/graduate-programs/autism-developmental-disabilities) at [UT Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/), advised by [Dr. Terry Falcomata](https://education.utexas.edu/faculty/terry_falcomata). My research is in behavioral variability, relapse and resurgence, and behavioral economics - implusivity and self control. To facilitate research across these areas, I have developed computer and app-based programs in Python, Swift, and Visual Basic. See [projects](/blog) for examples of programs I have created.

I hold a B.A. in psychology from [UT Austin](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/psychology/undergraduate/degree/index.php). I also hold an M.S. in behavior analysis from [Southern Illinois University](https://ehs.siu.edu/rehab/graduate/behavior-analysis/masters.php), where I worked on an NIH grant studying behavioral persistence with [Dr. Joel Ringdahl](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LpAhGmkAAAAJ&hl=en). My Master's thesis is titled [The Effects of Lag Schedules and Multiple Alternatives on Response Resurgence](assets/pdf/bagwell_thesis.pdf).

Over the course of completing my M.S. I worked at a number of organizations where I provided behavioral therapy to clients. I taught self-care, social skills, independent living, and self-advocacy at the [Evaluation and Development Center](https://ehs.siu.edu/rehab/service-programs/evaluation-development/), a residential transitional facility for young adults with disabilites. I worked developing and implementing behvaior plans and facilitating Acceptance and Commitment Therapy groups at [NeuroRestorative](https://www.neurorestorative.com/state-location/carbondale/), a residentail rehabilitation facility for adults recovering from traumatic and/or acquired brain injuries. I worked at [Project 12-Ways](https://project12-ways.siu.edu/) throught my M.S., training parents with DCFS involvement to exceed minimum parenting standards using evidence based, behavior analytic interventions. 

Over the course of completing my Ph.D. I have expanded my work experience into more research and teaching based applications. I spent my first year working at [Bluebonnet Trails Community Services](http://bbtrails.org/services/autism-services/) with children with ASD diagnoses, teaching iPad based communication and writing/implementing behavior plans based in ABA principles in home settings. Currently I work in three education/research based settings. I am the lab manager for the College of Education's [Assistive and Instructional Technology Lab](https://www.facebook.com/UT-Austin-Assistive-and-Instructional-Technology-Lab-1885640858333318/?ref=page_internal) where I facilitate orientations introducing pre-service teachers to assistive technology (AT). I lead the effort to transition the lab to a completely online model at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. This summer I will again serve as the TA for 2-course Applied Behavior Analysis sequence in the Autism and Development Disabilitys Masters program. I am also the manager of the human operant research lab I founded with my advisor in my first semester of my Ph.D. For more details, see my [CV](assets/pdf/CV-Ashley-Bagwell.pdf).
